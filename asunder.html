					A City Asunder

				<p>
					5/29/2020 
					<br><br>
					It’s dusk, maybe it’s nighttime now, the sky is purple grey & fading, the air is roasting, sunburnt and still hot to the touch. Motors belch & roar & headlights glare their twin glare across the lane—it’s a Friday night, & things have just begun. I suspect the city will shut down early tonight, but at 8:30 pm, or whatever time it is, we can still pretend.
					<br><br>
					Today I caught the free bus—one of the last—downtown to prepare myself for what I’m going to see this weekend. George Floyd is dead in Minneapolis & the nation is in turmoil—that city is ablaze & protests are staged all around the country. Police in Minneapolis have deployed tear gas, shot rubber bullets, & thrown concussion grenades at crowds of unarmed men, women, and children. Cops have been caught instigating property destruction & violence. One person was reported shot in a Minneapolis protest & seven were shot in Louisville, Kentucky—a city I drove through four years ago. The articles did not clarify who was shot, nor—almost more importantly—by whom. The Minneapolis Third Police Precinct was besieged by protestors, captured, & set on fire. Several buildings have burned to the ground.
					<br><br>
					There are protests set all weekend here in Austin. Tomorrow’s, at the Austin Police Department, looks to be larger, with almost a thousand people RSVPed on Facebook, though suspicion is gathering that it is organized by a front organization for the Red Guard, a radical revolutionary communist group that has taken violent & disruptive action against leftist groups—particularly the Austin DSA—in the past. They are militantly anti-electoralism & perpetrate against any groups that advocate in that domain. The fear here is that they may instigate violence against the police, putting their fellow protestors in physical danger; creating a legal risk for those who may be arrested; heightening the alertness, paranoia, & violent response by the police towards future protests; & losing the message of the demonstration in the overall ugliness of a brutal clash. The protest proposed for Sunday, by the DSA-backed Austin Justice Coalition, is a march from the Capitol to Austin City Hall, & is expressly nonviolent. The Facebook page for Saturday’s protest contains instructions for how to toss back tear gas canisters & penetrate police crowd control measures, as well as various first aid techniques.		 
					<br><br>
					As the DSA is trying to build national credibility, & due to the antagonistic history between the DSA & the Red Guard (totally perpetrated by the Red Guard), DSA members have disavowed Saturday’s protest & encouraged its members only to attend Sunday’s protest.			 
					<br><br>
					Personally, I am disgusted by what I have seen from the case in Minnesota—if only that word were stronger. As long as the police—the violent arm of the state—have the ability and the right to murder American citizens in cold blood & face no repercussions, we have no rights as a civic body. We exist only at their behest. For a murder to be caught on camera from start to finish—from George Floyd to #GeorgeFloyd—with numerous witnesses pleading for it to stop—for this not to constitute immediate apprehension by force of all parties involved is a degradation of, and a stain on, our civic society. We can have no civilized discourse while murderers lurk unpunished and uniformed in our streets. So long as they are free, we are not. The footage of a battalion of cops protecting the home of a murderer—in riot gear and by obvious threat of force—demonstrates more clearly than ever: there are no innocent cops. No man who stands in defense of an unarraigned murderer can claim to represent the rule of law. I am not recommending an imposition of vigilante justice—a lynching, if you will—but the when a defensive perimeter is formed around a murderer roaming free, all involved are implicated. We have already decided as a people: there is no “just following orders.”
					<br><br>
					Those advocating nonviolence in the demonstrations have a spirit and a depth of empathy that we should all greatly admire. Let it not be lost here that they are correct. But the United States of America have been steeped in racial conflict for centuries—it is our original sin. For the entirety of our nation’s existence on this Earth, it has perpetrated legal, mortal violence upon the Black man. For most of these centuries, he has been too downtrodden and overpowered to fight back against the enormous power of white ascendancy—in a nation he build with his own bloody and calloused hands. Only in the last sixty years or so has he gained even the semblance of the right to raise his voice—and this is the time for him to turn the other cheek?				 
					<br><br>
					The disciples of civil disobedience at the Woolsworth lunch counters peacefully accepted their degradation, their humiliation, and the threats against their lives. Their bravery and self-restraint are well deserving of the heroic depiction we foist upon them in history. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is portrayed, rightly, as a Christlike figure. But we would be remiss to consider these men and women outside of their historical context. How many of us were taught at length about the beliefs, rhetoric, tactics, life, and death, of Malcom X? How many of us learned in school that Dr. King was assassinated in the middle of a campaign to raise class consciousness among poor Americans, during a fight for redistribution of wealth, and immediately before meeting with the members of a striking workers’ union? We’ve all heard his Dream, but how many of us were taught the Language of the Unheard? History is written by the victors—and few who were assassinated are said to have won. Dr. King’s image and teachings have been whitewashed—language intentional—to blunt his teachings against the barbaric horrors of white supremacy and capitalism. It is my belief that these two matters cannot be separated, and that our society cheaply celebrates only the parts of Dr King’s message that do not conflict with our nation’s hegemonic powers.
					<br><br>
					I am going to attend Saturday’s protest at the police department. I am not going to let leftist sectarianism stop me from raising my voice against the murderous tendencies of our broken police system and our failing state. I do not believe that a passive response is appropriate to a homicidal state-sponsored paramilitary body that has gone completely unpunished for hundreds of years. There is no glory in allowing murderers to go free. That said, I will not instigate or perpetrate violence. I am not without sin, and I will not cast the first stone. If protesters or police incite violence or riot, I will separate myself from them. I will assist my fellow protestors and protect them to the best of my ability. I will use the color of my skin as a shield to those who are more vulnerable than me. Above all, I will document what I see—for history lives in the present. I will photograph, I will write down, and I will remember these days. I am a straight white male, and my voice carries an outsize weight in our society. By the strength of whatever God may be out there, let me record these days and let me tell them as they were, as long as I am fortunate enough to live.

				I saw some shit today. I saw police with beanbag shotguns firing indiscriminately into crowds of protestors. I saw police fill an unarmed man's face with pepper spray. I saw a cop rack a beanbag shotgun and point it directly in a protestor's face at point blank range. I saw a cop swing the barrel of his weapon wildly from a highway overpass at groups of people below, deciding who to shoot. I saw him think about it being me. I saw state troopers in full tactical gear carry M4 carbines with loaded magazines and the safety off. I tried to photograph the position of one cop's safety, and he covered it with his gloved hand. He stood there before me with his hand on the receiver of his rifle, so I asked him if he would ever shoot an unarmed protestor with a military weapon in Texas. I got no response.
				<br><br>
				A dialog requires two participants, so I did not see that. What I saw was a naked display of unseeing, unfeeling force from the state. The message was clear: they can do what they want, and they are not listening.
				<br><br>
				I did not see any protestors with weapons.
