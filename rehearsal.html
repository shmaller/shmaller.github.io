        <h2>Rehearsal calendar</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://whenisgood.net/y5f77az">Fill in the WhenIsGood here</a>, 
            and I'll update this page with the dates we're all free.
        </p>

        <h2>Rehearsal locations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Paul & Ben have offered the basement which I am happy to use but not for all of them so Paul doesn't have to listen to us fuck up too much</li>
            <li>Steve has access to a practice studio in East Williamsburg but we need to bring a bass amp (at least a head, they have a cab)</li>
            <li>I could reach out to Amber & Nyneve to rehearse at the Salon - especially important as date draws nearer (if we play there)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Show location</h2>
        <p>
            Nyneve said the Salon is available May 3. The Salon has a capacity of 70. After making a draft guest list 
            I have more than 70 invitees and could keep expanding it, plus I want you guys to invite people too + the 
            larger Salon community... currently trying to figure out a realistic attendee number but may need a bigger 
            venue.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a place on Empire called the Prop Closet or something that I have a connect with and
            could be a good location for a bigger show. (We would need to bring a drum kit, mixer, and PA.)
        </p>

        <h2>The band</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>me: rhythm guitar + vox</li>
            <li>Josh: lead guitar</li>
            <li>Ben: bass</li>
