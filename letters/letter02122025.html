            Hi friends, a quick note: today I released the first single, "Gone", off my upcoming album, lost&found&lostagain. I am targeting my birthday, May 3, as the release date for the full album. Here's the track:
            <br><br>
            <a href=https://nicholasboni.bandcamp.com/track/gone-single target="_blank">https://nicholasboni.bandcamp.com/track/gone-single</a>
            <br><br>
            You can stream my music for free on bandcamp and eventually the album will be on major streaming services. I am going to sell digital downloads and eventually CDs because making an album is a ton of work that has economic value, but I am not keeping any of the money. All revenue from the project will be matched by me and then donated to Crown Heights Mutual Aid. I'll post receipts on my Instagram page, @nicholasboniphoto.
            <br><br>
            I have been working on this project for over a year. In the middle of its production I got COVID, from which six months later I am still suffering moderate-to-severe cognitive effects which, at this point, I just have to accept as the way life is now. One symptom was a loss or inhibition of existing muscle memory; I kind of forgot how to play the guitar and the keys for a little while, in the same way you might forget a word -- you just can't think of it, you know it's there but it's hidden in a pall of mental static. But while working on this album drove me insane playing the same thing over and over into a microphone and fiddling with small details that only I will ever hear, it also gave me something I could work on in my house by myself when I was feeling too ill to go out and be social. So as much as I am satisfied with the completion of a collection of my own music, I am also grateful to this project for its weight and momentum to carry me through this time; it is the anchor towing my ship.
            <br><br>
            My music is not perfect; I am doing just about all of the playing, recording, and production, and I am an amateur in all three. When I listen to this it's still hard for me to hear anything but flaws. But making music is not about flawless perfection, and doing all this work just to listen to it alone in my apartment somehow feels more self centered than the embarrassment of self-promotion and begging people to listen to it.
            <br><br>
            So that's that. I will release one or two more singles in the coming weeks (apologies for the upcoming relative uptick in emails from me). If you're in NYC, I'm also starting to sketch out an album release show in early May, come through (details forthcoming). And then I'll move onto the next one.
