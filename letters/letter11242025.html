            <p>Hi,</p>

            <p>
                My audio engineering work was featured on the podcast Love Me on Radio Canada, 
                presented by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). The most recent 
                episode, "Worries", contains a segment titled "Hum", which was written and 
                performed by my friend Julie Piñero. I recorded her voiceover narration in my 
                home studio. This was back in June, and we turned off the air conditioning to 
                get a clean sound, so if you really listen, you may be able to hear how 
                incredibly hot it was in the room.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Hum" is an audio essay that tells the story of Julie and her mother being 
                diagnosed simultaneously with Tourette Syndrome, explores the relationship 
                between anxiety and control, and considers how to fit in while being visibly
                 different. It was really a joy to hear Julie perform this like eight to twelve 
                 times in a row.
            </p>
