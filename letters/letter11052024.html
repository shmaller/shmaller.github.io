            <p>. . . the stars were incredible, some of the best I have ever seen, especially 
                the last night after the party, when we laid out on the tennis court until 2 am -- 
                perfect seeing, no moon.
                <br><br>
                I found the National Audobon Society's Field Guide to the Night Sky at the used 
                bookstore in town. I used to be so mystified by the constellations, but that book 
                made it very easy to conceptualize & pick them out of the night sky. If I had had 
                a few more nights there I could have found more dim star clusters, nebulae, distant 
                galaxies -- but I could only find one or two new things per night, and we could only 
                look to the southeastern skies, away from the lights of the house.
                <br><br>
                A long weekend is criminally short, so I can only prepare myself for my next time under 
                the cosmos, which unfortunately may be a long time yet. If there is one thing I detest 
                about living in NYC -- there are a couple, but the foremost thing -- is how 
                astronomically far away I feel from the night sky, which in all other phases 
                of my life has been only a short drive away. I miss the RPI observatory, I miss 
                Grafton Lake, I miss the neighborhood under construction & not yet wired out on 
                TX-71, I miss the comet hanging over Balcones Canyonlands, I miss my telescope 
                in my backyard as a kid, looking at Jupiter's moons. I miss the eras of my life 
                when the night sky was dominant, when I spent hours under it totally alone in 
                perfect quiet, unnoticed & unaccounted for by anyone, driven into the ground by 
                its vastness like a nail beneath a hammer, like a seed into loam, nourished & 
                spreading roots. When the highest thing you can see is a rooftop, the world becomes 
                much smaller, and people seem unnaturally large.
                <br><br>
                One night walking through the field from Hoosick Street to my apartment at 
                    Stacwyck, perfectly clear, I passed into the woods looking skyward, only 
                    noticing I had entered them by the black silhouettes of branches projected
                     like fingers on the midnight, mesmerized, until I heard a loud snap right
                      in front of me -- I froze, & for a long moment, under starlight, leaning 
                      on our night vision, me & the doe tried to figure each other out.</p>
