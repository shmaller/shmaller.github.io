                I am squeaky-clean. I am sitting here at my desk up in the loft, in my sweatpants, 
                sipping wine, burning incense, & writing this letter by candlelight. I just finished 
                listening to the soulful tunes of Macy Gray. I am just fucking <u>vibing</u>.
                </p>

                <p>
                Today I woke up fairly early, around nine. It was cold in the loft. From the hole 
                in the floor, where the ladder is, I could see the dull cloudy tarnished silver of 
                a December morning in New York. A. was watching something on the TV, the sound of
                    which I tried to block out. Something about the light—its gentle stream, its softness,
                    its quiet plainness felt like a cool personality in the room, like a reverence. The 
                    room was full of clear unvarnished air, like the light filtering through the stained 
                    glass of a cathedral on a cloudy day, so it doesn’t take up the vibrant colors but 
                    just slips through, ordinary light, unassuming, unbeautiful, not radiant, homely, yet
                    present nonetheless. The kind of light that reminds you that not every day is 
                    sunshine and rainbows, but that every day is—the kind of light by which monks in
                    temples rake the lawns, carry water, garden, & expect no visitors. The kind of
                        light which does not draw people together & outside, & so the kind of light by 
                        which people sit alone, thinking. So, in recognition of that, I sat alone & I
                        thought.
                </p>

                <p>
                I sat up here in the dim holy light & meditated. I had a headache, so I 
                tried to explore that. I find that, when meditating, the mind is like a room, 
                full of your thoughts & impulses—one whose dimensions are felt, but not seen. 
                I imagined myself groping around a room in the dark, one whose shape I generally
                    know but whose layout is constantly changing. The headache seemed to reduce 
                    the size of that room, to jut, like a stalactite, into the space where my 
                    thoughts might otherwise be. Handling the contours of that intrusion into 
                    my mental cavern was uncomfortable, somewhat painful, but gave me an idea of 
                    what to expect from that compartment of my mind that day.

                I had a call with my therapist at three. Unlike last week, I remembered our 
                appointment. We discussed the compulsive, self-critical, intensely & aggressively
                    negative thoughts I think about myself during depressive episodes. He asked me 
                    to list the ways I am a huge piece of shit. This is a direct quote. The two 
                    main branches were 1) things I said or did to people I loved & respected to 
                    cause us to break up; awful, terrible, true things said to me, about me, in 
                    these situations; & 2) the one-to-one relationship between my artistic output
                    & my self-worth. We will tackle these in turn in future sessions, $40 at a time.

                I can hear the blizzard raging outside. The flakes started around two, little
                    flurries skittering through the sky, blown by the wind. By four, the air was 
                    white—the snow was driving, heavy, pure. At six I went for a walk. I put on my 
                    warmest jeans, long socks, a T-shirt, a flannel shirt, my hat, coat, gloves, 
                    hiking boots, & mask, & walked out. Instantly the wind tore through my clothes
                    & dumped snow on the back of my neck—the exclusion of my scarf was a mistake. 
                    I pulled my hat down to my collar, my collar up to my hat, my mask up to my eyes,
                    & trudged out. Driving snow & icy wind will either dry your eyeballs out or land
                    a flake right in them, so you have to keep your hat down below your brow, squint,
                        look down, & ideally get wherever the hell you’re going. But the snowstorm was
                        my destination.
                </p>

                <p>
                My favorite part of the snow is the quiet. Snowflakes in the air absorb sound, & fall 
                almost silently. They erase all the distant sounds we usually tune out, of distant road 
                noise, horns, alarms, whatever. I remember as a kid standing at the back door, watching 
                the fat wet globs come down, hoping for a snow day, & hearing the perfect, still, swirling
                    silence—just the sound of flakes collecting, the wind blowing, the seasons changing. 
                    Tonight as I walked I did not hear the city—just booted footsteps of lonely, hustling 
                    pedestrians; the odd scrape of a shovel on a sidewalk; the wet slap of tires riding 
                    carefully through the slush; the hum of the streetlights; the falling snow; & the total,
                    awesome, unperturbed quiet.
                </p>

                <p>
                I came back chilled to the bone, sopping wet, & white as a snowman. The forecast called for 
                8"-14” by tomorrow afternoon—at seven, there were at least six inches on the patio furniture
                    already.

                <p>
                I took a steaming hot shower—my skin prickled at first, then relented.
