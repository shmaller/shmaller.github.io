				Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyrining imperthnthn thnthnthn. A husky fifenote blew.<br>Blew. Blue bloom is on the<br>Gold pinnacled hair.<br>A jumping rose on satiny breasts of satin, rose of Castille.<br>In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter.<br><br>Ah, panting, sighing. Sighing, ah, fordone their mirth died down.
