				Fifteen Years Later
			</h1>

			<p>
				It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Brooklyn. There’s a painted grey blanket of sky over
				the city. Gulls, pigeons, sparrows, airplanes hang in the air. A husky man in his mid-thirties
				wearing a windbreaker jacket and a Mets hat walks his chocolate Labrador down the sidewalk.
				Cars stream over the bridge into Manhattan. I place my foot up on the radiator as I
				look out the window. The Freedom Tower, rending the sky where the World Trade Center once
				stood, domineers the downtown skyline across the river until the F train lumbers into the above-
				ground station across the street to block all but the highest spire from view.
				<br><br>
				To think that fifteen years ago those buildings fell. To think that fifteen years ago
				someone could have stood in this exact spot and watched an inky black tongue of smoke flutter
				dazedly from the gaping jagged maw of smashed steel, spitting flames and bits of burning cheap
				carpet. To think if they stood here &amp; watched in silent horrified awe for long enough at the
				absurd tragic consequences they could have seen the second plane come in to give everyone
				wondering, “how could this happen?” a sick, macabre instant replay.
				<br><br>
				To think that fifteen years ago I was a small child in a classroom told by a despondent,
				grief-stricken teacher about an act I didn’t understand, I couldn’t understand, no one will ever
				fully understand; that I knew nothing about what the world could contain, all the beauty &amp;
				wonder of a sunshine blue sky &amp; the terrible strangeness of an artificial cloud of black to disfigure
				it. I may not have comprehended that day but the world was older than me, the world felt the
				earth shake, the world saw the falling bodies wrapped in business suits, the world understood, or
				at least felt some inkling of the ramifications that would come of this.
				<br><br>
				That day I went to the playground for recess, just as a boy getting dressed now with his
				parents will, &amp; if he glimpses that tower through the bus window on the way to school he’ll have
				no reason to look twice at it, he’ll look at it as he’d see any other brownstone apartment or the
				Empire State Building or the city itself or the Hudson River or the Atlantic Ocean: as eternal, as
				having existed since Creation, since the beginning of time. In time he’ll <em>learn</em>, but he’ll never
				<em>remember</em>; in time the world will <em>learn</em>, but there’ll be no one left to <em>remember</em> watching those
				buildings fall, trying to figure out the backward rationale of that day, realizing there was never
				anything to get.
