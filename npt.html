        <h3>8/24</h3>

        <p>
            Woke up on time in Trevor’s bed at 7:15 am. His mom took a photo of us in the driveway. The dogs were excited & knew something was up. Went & picked up Jack, & drove a few exits down I-90 to Amsterdam. Rt. 30 was closed so we took a big long detour through Galway. Jack & I were pretty carsick.
            <br><br>
            Got to the trailhead at 9:30, which was a small parking lot on the main drag of Northville. Walked 3.5 mi on the road over a bridge crossing Great Sacandaga Lake, past a golf course, & down a gravel road to the woods. Sunny, dappled, up & down, some switchbacks. Got to Mud Lake easily & ran into a group of three older thru-hikers, two girls & a guy, all 50+. Deborah (Rockie).
            <br><br>
            Pressed on to some stream, beautiful sluice of water cutting through the dense forest. Stony path across. Laid here in the sun, dunked our raw feet & splashed water on our faces, ate lunch. An old guy hung dong across the stream from us.
            <br><br>
            * After fording the stream, some knocked down tree branches & trunks that make it difficult to find the trail.
            <br><br>
            Up & down, exhausting miles.
            <br><br>
            * Saw baby & probably mama black bears crossing the trail ~1 mile after stream. I was in front & froze, said, “I think that’s a bear.” Saw maybe 150 ft ahead on trail. Backed up slowly, got knife & harmonica out. Started talking loudly, yelling, playing harmonica loudly & dissonantly & shrilly. Waited 5-10 min, then proceeded with bags unclipped, knife in hand, yelling & walking slowly, then apace.
            <br><br>
            Another ~1.5 mi to the road, & then a short walk across the road to Woods Lake. Sunset falling behind tall pines & mountains in the distance, blue to peach in perfect gradient. What a painting wants to be.
            <br><br>
            Lots of work to set up camp, cook dinner, start a fire, etc. Dead tired, sore, large blisters on my feet. Twelve more miles tomorrow!
        </p>

        <h3>8/25</h3>

        <p>
            Woke up to rain on the tents around 6 am, put on the rain flys. Fell asleep to the pitter-patter of rain until about 8:30 or 8:45. had breakfast & coffee on the lake, stretched out, & left late at 10:30 am.
            <br><br>
            Popped an enormous blister on the pad of my left foot which bled & hurt a lot. Right now it’s an open wound on the bottom of my foot.
            <br><br>
            Crossed Abner Creek after a long hike, & then Stony Creek North not long after. Disinfected, bandaged, & taped the cut which felt much better after. Dunked both feet in the icy creek which numbed & soothed them.
            <br><br>
            Good walking through a glittering, enchanted forest. Pristine, remote, leafy low vegetation all around catching golden bands of sun. Played the harmonica loud which rang through the woods.
            <br><br>
            Took a lake lunch in the waning heat of the day at Rock Lake.
            <br><br>
            * Lots of blowdown between Rock Lake & Silver Lake.
            <br><br>
            Powered through the last 2.5 mi past Nico Lake & onto Silver Lake. Finally caught up with a girl who’s probably Abby, traveling solo with her big white guard dog Lou. Set up camp & then watched the sun slip behind the mountain, sending glittering black & gold shadows rippling over the surface of the large lake. Sat there in silence through the golden hour, watching the clouds go by, turning from gold to peach to orange to bruised.
            <br><br>
            Built a fire & made mac & cheese w/ tuna. Washed the dishes down in the lake under the first quarter moon. Jupiter was beaming through the trees, & some other stars were starting to come out, but I was too tired to stay & look at them. Sometime soon.
            <br><br>
            Twelve more miles tomorrow to Hamilton something-or-other.
        </p>

        <h3>8/26</h3>

        <p>
            Had lots of intense dreams in the lean-to & woke up several times in pain. Don’t remember any of the dreams, except one involving Kelli Kravetz & getting in a car accident.
            <br><br>
            Got up around 7:30 am in a chill morning, really sore with cut-up feet. I was scared about the blister-turned-gash on my left foot & how long I could walk on it, & something similar formed on my right. Afraid of infection. Hiked 2.5 mi to Canary Pond & had breakfast there on the banks, on sunny boulders jutting out into the water.
            <br><br>
            * Lots of blowdown between Silver Lake & C.P. First vlei after C.P. OK, but later ones on the way to Mud Lake were broken, had loose boards.
            <br><br>
            After C.P., passed through an enormous vlei on long footbridges of halved logs. Beaming low yellowgreen fronds deep on all sides rimmed by forest. Crossed through a muddy area on the edge of a beaver pond/marsh. The trail detoured between the huge uprooted trunks of two great fallen trees at 90 degrees to each other, the fallen trunk taking up with it the mound of earth it wrapped.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            It seemed like an enchanted place, where we might find the site of magic or buried treasure. I often thought of the Mirwood Forest today. Long, open, flat expanses of forest with low, leafy foliage among the trees. Jack got stung by a bee
            <br><br>
            Made it to a lean-to at Mud Lake for Clif bars & water. Gorgeous scenery but was too tired mentally to take much in.
            <br><br>
            Crushed 3 mi or so to the Great Sacandaga River where we crossed a long suspension bridge. Laid ourselves out on the rocks from ~3-4pm, had PB&J tacos. Jack took a swim in the river. We watched a group of teenagers, two guys & two girls, walk farther down the river, take all their clothes off, & swim to a large rock in the middle of the stream.
            <br><br>
            A long & draining 2.3 mi through the slanted golden late-afternoon sunshine over another suspension bridge to the lean-to. A man-bunned guy named Darby was already here; we’d met him at the Mud Lake lean-to. He’s from Blacksburg, VA, has done the Appalachian Trail, & does not know Ryan Curtis.
            <br><br>
            Dinner tonight was chicken-flavored ramen, Thai chili tuna, almonds, & a Snickers.
            <br><br>
            We broke up tomorrow’s 17 mi suicide mission, so we will be stopping in the town of Piseco to resupply, & hopefully find a place to eat, as part of an 11 mi day to Fall Creek Campsite. My beat-up feet are grateful for the “shortening” & I’m already sort of looking forward to it.
            <br><br>
            Lights out—can’t keep Trevor up any longer.
        </p>

        <h3>8/28</h3>
        <p>
            Writing this in bed with Trevor at the Oxbow Lake Motel.
            <br><br>
            Day 4
             <br><br>
            Trev & I woke up at 6 am, & rain started down on us not long after. Ate breakfast in the lean-to with Darby. He was out quickly & we got on the trail around 8:15, with full rain gear & pack covers on. The forest was bright gray & slick & shining green. We passed by some beaver ponds & at times trudged through mud. We saw a beaver dam built up in a marsh with ivy & growth spilling over it.
             <br><br>
            After a few miles we hit the trail register at Rt. 8 which had Reese’s & Powerade in it for us. It was strange & exciting to see houses & a road after three full days of isolation & so much travel. We spilled out at a defunct corner store & liquor store. Trev & I stashed our packs in the reeds, & Jack carried his, to the Oxbow Inn, a tavern a few tenths up the road, but it didn’t open until 4, so we walked back to our packs & hoofed up Co. Rt. 24, Old Piseco Rd., to make it to the Piseco post office before noon. I held my thumb out for each passing car. The first pickup slowed down, but just told us the office was a mile up the road. A mile later, another pickup told us it was only another mile up the road. We hoofed through the rain. The hard road was agonizing on my ruined feet & my sore Achilles. The second guy came back around for us & let us ride on his tailgate to the post office. We swung our tired feet as half a mile of hard blacktop flew by effortlessly. We hopped out, collected 30 lbs of food, & mailed back our books. Then we made a short, hard walk to the men’s bathroom of the Piseco airport. We hid in there from the rain & saw electric light & used plumbing for the first time in days. We were soaking wet & stinking & exhausted. We repacked our bags, ate lunch, hid from the rain, & recuperated for two hours. Then we hiked along the road & back into the woods, four more miles to Fall Creek.
             <br><br>
            My feet hurt the worst yet even though I’d re-bandaged them twice that day, but with the rain I couldn’t keep them dry. I said I was in a lot of pain & Jack said to “listen to your body,” which his the phrase that tipped me. I was tired & hurting & wanted to cry because I knew I was fucking up the whole trip. But at lights out I said that my feet couldn’t take me to Lake Placid & that I was burning too many medical supplies to safely keep going. Things were only getting worse. We decided to walk back to Piseco & see what we could learn about availability here, in Speculator, or in Long Lake.
             <br><br>
            Day 5
             <br><br>
            We got up late & got going slowly. Retraced the 4 mi through the woods & came out on a wood gathering operation. Turns out the guy gathering wood gives rides, so he drove us in the bed of his truck to the Oxbow Lake Motel. We ate next door at the place we were rejected yesterday & then walked over & checked in. Matt (or Bob) from Matt & Bob’s Firewood gave Trevor a ride to Speculator for beer & medical supplies. We all showered, I packed my wounds & haven’t moved since. My feet are wide open & oozing profusely. Stopping the hike was the right call. Sunday the guy will drive us to Lake Placid for $225, & then J&T will restart the hike from Long Lake. I don’t know what I’ll do after that, but I won’t be able to walk for weeks.
        
        <h3>8/30</h3>
        <p>
            Writing this from the Lake Eaton Campground, just north of Long Lake.
             <br><br>
            Day 6 was pretty lazy. We were stuck in the Oxbow Lake Motel, miles from anything but the tavern next door, & I couldn’t walk. We woke up early & made oatmeal & coffee. We played poker at the small table, bought in twice & lost all my money. Almonds were 10 cents, allergy pills 25 cents, diarrhea pills 50 cents, & dollar bills. We finished playing & it was still only 11 am or so. It rained. We started drinking beers around noon.
             <br><br>
            In the afternoon the sun came out & Jack & I took the kayaks from the boat launch, with a joint, of course. I was careful not to get my bandaged feet wet. We cut out to the left, since Trevor had explored right the day before. We paddled against the wind alongside towering but modest Oxbow Mountain into a clot of lily pads which held fast onto the hulls of the kayaks. We smoked the j & started laughing about how incredibly difficult the past four days had been. It also struck us how beautiful the lake we were on was & what a luxury it was to be slung so low on the water of it, so close to the rippled surface with a perfect perspective. Over Oxbow Mountain & the pined ridges in the distance the clouds were fastmoving & puffy & numerous & shapely & all different colors of white, gray, & purple against the perfect blue sky. As we looked east at them, a looming dark thunderhead crept over the mountains & overtook us from the west. Suddenly we were at the front of a rainstorm & the only two things on the wide surface of the water. The wind had shifted & blown us across the lake from the motel, so we paddled as fast as we could to cross the open water & be at the relative safety of the shoreline before the heavy rain & lightning started. In my frantic state my paddling got sloppy & I was splashing myself a lot, but I just had to calm myself & say, “just focus on paddling correctly & quickly, keep good & efficient form, cross the water quickly, & don’t worry about getting hit, because you can’t control it at this point.” We made it to the dock quickly & gratefully, which was still half-drenched in sun. We stashed the kayaks & hit the room, where Trevor was watching the Bucks-Magic game & folding his laundry. Not five minutes after we got in, the downpour started & we lost the TV signal. The error message on the TV suggested to “remove the obstruction” to the satellite antenna, so I laughed & asked Trevor to go out & remove the raincloud.
             <br><br>
            For the rest of the night we just sat around, ate dinner, packed our bags, & watched basketball.
             <br><br>
            Day 7
             <br><br>
            We got up at 7:15, fixed up the room, packed our bags, & tossed them into Bob’s Mazda. He had us all wear masks & kept the windows cracked. I sat shotgun while T&J zoned out through the windows in the back.
             <br><br>
            Bob’s an older dude, probably 65 or 70 with white hair & a wide mustache. He runs the campwood service & keeps the local places around Piseco stocked with firewood. He also maintains the snowmobile trails around Piseco & gives rides to hikers between Northville, Piseco, Long Lake, & Lake Placid. He said he’d broken his wrist in the spring & was still wearing a brace, so he wasn’t as good at manual labor anymore, but could still drive, so he was doing more of that. He knew the history of each little town we passed through & the various land disputes, openings, closures, & famous residents. One of the towns—I can’t remember which now, I’d have to look back at the map again, but one of them on Rt. 30 just had its grocery store close down, & so the residents now have to drive some 30 mi to Long Lake or Indian Falls(?) for food. I was struck at how austere life in these mountains already was, & what a blow it was to the quality of life of the residents to lose their only supply of food within half an hour’s 60+ mph drive. The coming winter will be brutal. The town is building a bigger Stewart’s, but as Bob said, “that’s good for chips and shit, but it’s not real food. You can’t raise a family on Stewart’s.” He also laughingly remarked that their existing Stewart’s was the smallest location of all, but sold the most beer out of any store. I wonder if he saw a connection there. I was reminded of a story I’d read somewhere—maybe on NPR—where a rural town somewhere had had its grocery store close down, making it into a food desert, so the citizens of the town formed a food co-op at their town hall. I wonder if I can find that article again, & if a similar model would apply.
             <br><br>
            As we drove through Saranac Lake, he remarked that it was “too built up” for him—he preferred the slow, quiet backwoods of Piseco. But as he described the real estate history of these mountains he seemed to favor the development & maintenance of new settlements, because he thought it would bring jobs to the people of the area. He remarked that the Adirondack Park was unbending in its position on the land use of the mountains. “‘Forever Wild,’ ‘Forever Wild,’” he said. “Which is good, in some sense, but—” & he trailed off.
