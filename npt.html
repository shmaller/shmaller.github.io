            <a href="letters.html"><img class="nav-icon" src="images/leftarrow.png"></a>

            <p>
                At the height of the pandemic, we planned to disappear into the woods.
                Jack, Trevor, and I planned a twelve-day, 136-mile thru-hike of the 
                Northville-Placid Trail.
            </p>

            <p>
                Injuries and poor planning turned our twelve-day hike into the five-year
                one chronicled below.

                <h3>8/24</h3>

                <p>
                    Woke up on time in Trevor’s bed at 7:15 am. His mom took a photo of us 
                    in the driveway. The dogs were excited & knew something was up. Went & 
                    picked up Jack, & drove a few exits down I-90 to Amsterdam. Rt. 30 was 
                    closed so we took a big long detour through Galway. Jack & I were pretty 
                    carsick.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Got to the trailhead at 9:30, which was a small parking lot on the main 
                    drag of Northville. Walked 3.5 mi on the road over a bridge crossing Great 
                    Sacandaga Lake, past a golf course, & down a gravel road to the woods. Sunny, 
                    dappled, up & down, some switchbacks. Got to Mud Lake easily & ran into a 
                    group of three older thru-hikers, two girls & a guy, all 50+. Deborah (Rockie).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pressed on to some stream, beautiful sluice of water cutting through the dense 
                    forest. Stony path across. Laid here in the sun, dunked our raw feet & splashed 
                    water on our faces, ate lunch. An old guy hung dong across the stream from us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    * After fording the stream, some knocked down tree branches & trunks that make 
                    it difficult to find the trail.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Up & down, exhausting miles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    * Saw baby & probably mama black bears crossing the trail ~1 mile after stream. 
                    I was in front & froze, said, “I think that’s a bear.” Saw maybe 150 ft ahead 
                    on trail. Backed up slowly, got knife & harmonica out. Started talking loudly, 
                    yelling, playing harmonica loudly & dissonantly & shrilly. Waited 5-10 min, 
                    then proceeded with bags unclipped, knife in hand, yelling & walking slowly, 
                    then apace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another ~1.5 mi to the road, & then a short walk across the road to Woods 
                    Lake. Sunset falling behind tall pines & mountains in the distance, blue to 
                    peach in perfect gradient. What a painting wants to be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lots of work to set up camp, cook dinner, start a fire, etc. Dead tired, 
                    sore, large blisters on my feet. Twelve more miles tomorrow!

                <h3>8/25</h3>

                <p>
                    Woke up to rain on the tents around 6 am, put on the rain flys. Fell asleep
                     to the pitter-patter of rain until about 8:30 or 8:45. had breakfast & coffee 
                     on the lake, stretched out, & left late at 10:30 am.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Popped an enormous blister on the pad of my left foot which bled & hurt a lot. 
                    Right now it’s an open wound on the bottom of my foot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Crossed Abner Creek after a long hike, & then Stony Creek North not long after. Disinfected, bandaged, & taped the cut which felt much better after. Dunked both feet in the icy creek which numbed & soothed them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good walking through a glittering, enchanted forest. Pristine, remote, leafy low vegetation all around catching golden bands of sun. Played the harmonica loud which rang through the woods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Took a lake lunch in the waning heat of the day at Rock Lake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    * Lots of blowdown between Rock Lake & Silver Lake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Powered through the last 2.5 mi past Nico Lake & onto Silver Lake. Finally caught up with a girl who’s probably Abby, traveling solo with her big white guard dog Lou. Set up camp & then watched the sun slip behind the mountain, sending glittering black & gold shadows rippling over the surface of the large lake. Sat there in silence through the golden hour, watching the clouds go by, turning from gold to peach to orange to bruised.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Built a fire & made mac & cheese w/ tuna. Washed the dishes down in the lake under the first quarter moon. Jupiter was beaming through the trees, & some other stars were starting to come out, but I was too tired to stay & look at them. Sometime soon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Twelve more miles tomorrow to Hamilton something-or-other.

                <h3>8/26</h3>

                <p>
                    Had lots of intense dreams in the lean-to & woke up several times in pain. Don’t remember any of the dreams, except one involving Kelli Kravetz & getting in a car accident.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Got up around 7:30 am in a chill morning, really sore with cut-up feet. I was scared about the blister-turned-gash on my left foot & how long I could walk on it, & something similar formed on my right. Afraid of infection. Hiked 2.5 mi to Canary Pond & had breakfast there on the banks, on sunny boulders jutting out into the water.
                </p>

                <p>
                    * Lots of blowdown between Silver Lake & C.P. First vlei after C.P. OK, but later ones on the way to Mud Lake were broken, had loose boards.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After C.P., passed through an enormous vlei on long footbridges of halved logs. Beaming low yellowgreen fronds deep on all sides rimmed by forest. Crossed through a muddy area on the edge of a beaver pond/marsh. The trail detoured between the huge uprooted trunks of two great fallen trees at 90 degrees to each other, the fallen trunk taking up with it the mound of earth it wrapped.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It seemed like an enchanted place, where we might find the site of magic or buried treasure. I often thought of the Mirwood Forest today. Long, open, flat expanses of forest with low, leafy foliage among the trees. Jack got stung by a bee
                </p>

                <p>
                    Made it to a lean-to at Mud Lake for Clif bars & water. Gorgeous scenery but was too tired mentally to take much in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Crushed 3 mi or so to the Great Sacandaga River where we crossed a long suspension bridge. Laid ourselves out on the rocks from ~3-4pm, had PB&J tacos. Jack took a swim in the river. We watched a group of teenagers, two guys & two girls, walk farther down the river, take all their clothes off, & swim to a large rock in the middle of the stream.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A long & draining 2.3 mi through the slanted golden late-afternoon sunshine over another suspension bridge to the lean-to. A man-bunned guy named Darby was already here; we’d met him at the Mud Lake lean-to. He’s from Blacksburg, VA, has done the Appalachian Trail, & does not know Ryan Curtis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dinner tonight was chicken-flavored ramen, Thai chili tuna, almonds, & a Snickers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We broke up tomorrow’s 17 mi suicide mission, so we will be stopping in the town of Piseco to resupply, & hopefully find a place to eat, as part of an 11 mi day to Fall Creek Campsite. My beat-up feet are grateful for the “shortening” & I’m already sort of looking forward to it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lights out—can’t keep Trevor up any longer.

                    Writing this in bed with Trevor at the Oxbow Lake Motel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Day 4
                </p>

                <p>
                    Trev & I woke up at 6 am, & rain started down on us not long after. Ate breakfast in the lean-to with Darby. He was out quickly & we got on the trail around 8:15, with full rain gear & pack covers on. The forest was bright gray & slick & shining green. We passed by some beaver ponds & at times trudged through mud. We saw a beaver dam built up in a marsh with ivy & growth spilling over it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After a few miles we hit the trail register at Rt. 8 which had Reese’s & Powerade in it for us. It was strange & exciting to see houses & a road after three full days of isolation & so much travel. We spilled out at a defunct corner store & liquor store. Trev & I stashed our packs in the reeds, & Jack carried his, to the Oxbow Inn, a tavern a few tenths up the road, but it didn’t open until 4, so we walked back to our packs & hoofed up Co. Rt. 24, Old Piseco Rd., to make it to the Piseco post office before noon. I held my thumb out for each passing car. The first pickup slowed down, but just told us the office was a mile up the road. A mile later, another pickup told us it was only another mile up the road. We hoofed through the rain. The hard road was agonizing on my ruined feet & my sore Achilles. The second guy came back around for us & let us ride on his tailgate to the post office. We swung our tired feet as half a mile of hard blacktop flew by effortlessly. We hopped out, collected 30 lbs of food, & mailed back our books. Then we made a short, hard walk to the men’s bathroom of the Piseco airport. We hid in there from the rain & saw electric light & used plumbing for the first time in days. We were soaking wet & stinking & exhausted. We repacked our bags, ate lunch, hid from the rain, & recuperated for two hours. Then we hiked along the road & back into the woods, four more miles to Fall Creek.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My feet hurt the worst yet even though I’d re-bandaged them twice that day, but with the rain I couldn’t keep them dry. I said I was in a lot of pain & Jack said to “listen to your body,” which his the phrase that tipped me. I was tired & hurting & wanted to cry because I knew I was fucking up the whole trip. But at lights out I said that my feet couldn’t take me to Lake Placid & that I was burning too many medical supplies to safely keep going. Things were only getting worse. We decided to walk back to Piseco & see what we could learn about availability here, in Speculator, or in Long Lake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Day 5
                </p>

                <p>
                    We got up late & got going slowly. Retraced the 4 mi through the woods & came out on a wood gathering operation. Turns out the guy gathering wood gives rides, so he drove us in the bed of his truck to the Oxbow Lake Motel. We ate next door at the place we were rejected yesterday & then walked over & checked in. Matt (or Bob) from Matt & Bob’s Firewood gave Trevor a ride to Speculator for beer & medical supplies. We all showered, I packed my wounds & haven’t moved since. My feet are wide open & oozing profusely. Stopping the hike was the right call. Sunday the guy will drive us to Lake Placid for $225, & then J&T will restart the hike from Long Lake. I don’t know what I’ll do after that, but I won’t be able to walk for weeks.

                    Writing this from the Lake Eaton Campground, just north of Long Lake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Day 6 was pretty lazy. We were stuck in the Oxbow Lake Motel, miles from anything but the tavern next door, & I couldn’t walk. We woke up early & made oatmeal & coffee. We played poker at the small table, bought in twice & lost all my money. Almonds were 10 cents, allergy pills 25 cents, diarrhea pills 50 cents, & dollar bills. We finished playing & it was still only 11 am or so. It rained. We started drinking beers around noon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the afternoon the sun came out & Jack & I took the kayaks from the boat launch, with a joint, of course. I was careful not to get my bandaged feet wet. We cut out to the left, since Trevor had explored right the day before. We paddled against the wind alongside towering but modest Oxbow Mountain into a clot of lily pads which held fast onto the hulls of the kayaks. We smoked the j & started laughing about how incredibly difficult the past four days had been. It also struck us how beautiful the lake we were on was & what a luxury it was to be slung so low on the water of it, so close to the rippled surface with a perfect perspective. Over Oxbow Mountain & the pined ridges in the distance the clouds were fastmoving & puffy & numerous & shapely & all different colors of white, gray, & purple against the perfect blue sky. As we looked east at them, a looming dark thunderhead crept over the mountains & overtook us from the west. Suddenly we were at the front of a rainstorm & the only two things on the wide surface of the water. The wind had shifted & blown us across the lake from the motel, so we paddled as fast as we could to cross the open water & be at the relative safety of the shoreline before the heavy rain & lightning started. In my frantic state my paddling got sloppy & I was splashing myself a lot, but I just had to calm myself & say, “just focus on paddling correctly & quickly, keep good & efficient form, cross the water quickly, & don’t worry about getting hit, because you can’t control it at this point.” We made it to the dock quickly & gratefully, which was still half-drenched in sun. We stashed the kayaks & hit the room, where Trevor was watching the Bucks-Magic game & folding his laundry. Not five minutes after we got in, the downpour started & we lost the TV signal. The error message on the TV suggested to “remove the obstruction” to the satellite antenna, so I laughed & asked Trevor to go out & remove the raincloud.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the rest of the night we just sat around, ate dinner, packed our bags, & watched basketball.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Day 7
                </p>

                <p>
                    We got up at 7:15, fixed up the room, packed our bags, & tossed them into Bob’s Mazda. He had us all wear masks & kept the windows cracked. I sat shotgun while T&J zoned out through the windows in the back.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bob’s an older dude, probably 65 or 70 with white hair & a wide mustache. He runs the campwood service & keeps the local places around Piseco stocked with firewood. He also maintains the snowmobile trails around Piseco & gives rides to hikers between Northville, Piseco, Long Lake, & Lake Placid. He said he’d broken his wrist in the spring & was still wearing a brace, so he wasn’t as good at manual labor anymore, but could still drive, so he was doing more of that. He knew the history of each little town we passed through & the various land disputes, openings, closures, & famous residents. One of the towns—I can’t remember which now, I’d have to look back at the map again, but one of them on Rt. 30 just had its grocery store close down, & so the residents now have to drive some 30 mi to Long Lake or Indian Falls(?) for food. I was struck at how austere life in these mountains already was, & what a blow it was to the quality of life of the residents to lose their only supply of food within half an hour’s 60+ mph drive. The coming winter will be brutal. The town is building a bigger Stewart’s, but as Bob said, “that’s good for chips and shit, but it’s not real food. You can’t raise a family on Stewart’s.” He also laughingly remarked that their existing Stewart’s was the smallest location of all, but sold the most beer out of any store. I wonder if he saw a connection there. I was reminded of a story I’d read somewhere—maybe on NPR—where a rural town somewhere had had its grocery store close down, making it into a food desert, so the citizens of the town formed a food co-op at their town hall. I wonder if I can find that article again, & if a similar model would apply.

                    As we drove through Saranac Lake, he remarked that it was “too built up” for him—he preferred the slow, quiet backwoods of Piseco. But as he described the real estate history of these mountains he seemed to favor the development & maintenance of new settlements, because he thought it would bring jobs to the people of the area. He remarked that the Adirondack Park was unbending in its position on the land use of the mountains. “‘Forever Wild,’ ‘Forever Wild,’” he said. “Which is good, in some sense, but—” & he trailed off.

                    Back on the NPT tomorrow after three years. It’s thunderstorming outside right now, hopefully getting it out of the way. There days in the backwoods of the north country, I’m fortunate, grateful, & excited.

                <p>
                    Day 5 of the NPT. Hiked from the road in Piseco, crushed 4.5 mi & ate at Fall Stream, then pressed on farther than ever before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This morning we walked to get breakfast sandwiches & coffee, Trevor stopped & picked us up along the way. We got poured on. Packed our bags in the room. I gave jelly to the kitchen staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A loon is singing on the lake & its call is echoing through the trees & hills on the far shore. I’m sitting on Spruce Lake with Jack, watching the last light of day fade. Birds twittering, far off thunder, blips on the water from bugs & breezes. Mosquitoes are feasting on me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wet hike, several stream crossings & slippery fords. Made amazing time & got to Spruce Lake #1 just in time to shelter from a passing thunderstorm. A grandpa, son-in-law, & two young daughters joined us just in time, from outside of Utica.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spruce Lake is spindly & long & pined & beautiful & warm. I hope I can take a dip tomorrow before we roll out, though I’m afraid I’ll be naked & wet when we’re trying to go. We hit two more chains of lakes tomorrow, maybe I’ll save it for then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expecting a lot of wildlife sounds tonight—hopefully more loonsong, hopefully clear skies.

                <p>
                    Really challenging but wonderful day. Tons & tons of blowdown & muck around Mud Lake, 
                    very slow going & treacherous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Woke up late on the water at Spruce Lake #2 in a hidden campsite down the left of the 
                    lean-to which is a much nicer spot right on the water. Hiked up to West Canada Lake, 
                    challenging & steep at times with several gorgeous streams & falls traversed by wooden 
                    footbridges. Made it to West Lake, was already pretty tired. We played leapfrog with a 
                    big group of seven guys, racing them to the lean-to we’re at now—though it’s totally 
                    full with a big family so we made a tent site just off to the side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    West Lake was huge, steel-blue, choppy, & beautiful. Jack found a nice set of boulders 
                    jutting out into the water where we had lunch. They swam, but I just laid out in the 
                    sun & closed my eyes. Bit of a tummyache today. Got back on the trail & through the mud
                     & bog & crazy fallen trees, narrow & overgrown with brush, until we made it to the 
                     little clearing leading into Cedar Lake #3. we plowed right through & did the 2 mi to
                      #2, set up camp & ate dinner on a small rocky beach at the shore of Cedar Lake, which 
                      is also enormous, peaceful, & beautiful. I’m running out of adjectives for these 
                      lakes—it’s an unwriteable experience. Hopefully the photos come out well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we hung the bear bag & now we’re exhausted in tents. 10.4 mi tomorrow back to the car.

            <h3>8/6</h3>
            <p>
                Woke up at 6:05 am after a totally silent night, no crickets or frogs or anything, an amazing sleep with really nice dreams, to a thick fog coming off of Cedar Lake. Got everything assembled quickly, took a few photos from the beach & then set off just as the sun started to punch through the fog.
            </p>
            <p>
                As soon as you leave Cedar Lake the trail is totally feral, all blowdown & bogs. A good stretch that seemed to go right through an arm of the lake, if you misplace your step you’d be in a foot of water at least, dead trees on either side pushing & poking you sharply into the water. Difficult going.
            </p>
            <p>
                But once we passed that, the rest of the day was a cakewalk along fairly wide, level terrain. The person in front ate about a million spiderwebs, some of them huge & intricate & populated by large spiders & their prey. Good walk to Carry, which is called something else on the signs, Cedar River Lean-to or something? I have a photo that will confirm. Nice spot on a grassy bend of the Cedar River, which we followed all day—super mosquitoey though. Trevor had a cloud of them following him from Carry to the campsite at the Cedar River Flow, where we stopped for one last embrace with nature & the lakes & the mountains before pushing on to the car, a quick hike out down a gravel road. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Steak sandwich at a place in Speculator, bangin malt around the corner, & then drove back through Amsterdam. Really beautiful drive, nodded off to Neil Young but woke up for the I-90 ride back into Albany, & then a spin down memory lane on Wolf Road & Albany-Shaker. The best shower of my life, two empanadas, some guitar & now laying braindead in the attic, thinking about my workday tomorrow & the train ride back to the city.

                <h3>7/26</h3>

                <p>Short, easy day to Stevens Pond, about 9 mi which we did in just over 4 hrs.</p>
                <p>Parked the car exactly where we left off one year ago at Wakely Dam & walked 0.7 mi along the road, then dove into the forest. The trail book said we would start in birches & end in maples, so we kept a careful eye on the trees around us. Halfway through we crossed a plank bridge over a powerful creek that looked almost orange in color—perhaps because of the color of the underlying rocks?</p>
                <p>A brief, pretty, flat, easy hike into the pond. No one else is here, & no one had checked into the trail register ahead of us for three days. Hoping the solitude continues.</p>
                <p>We arrived to an empty lean-to & a few nice campsites around Stevens Pond. I stripped & jumped in & the water is incredibly pleasant. Felt good on my stiff ankles & fat(?) & my sweaty hair. We’ve been laying around on these rocks jutting out into the water for hours now. I am sitting here without a shirt in the shade of a tall tree watching the breeze gently shimmer the water, I am well-rested & well-fed. Two loons are hunting on the water. There is a ladybug on my pants. I can only hear crickets & birds singing in the forest, the loons splashing, the wind in the trees, this pen on the paper, Jack & Trevor’s voices carrying on the water as they chatter, sunning themselves on a rock by our campsite to dry off from their swim. Hours lounging in the sun on a couch-shaped rock. </p>

                <h3>7/27</h3>
                <p>On the beach at Tirrell Pond after a short, straightforward day.</p>
                <p>After watching the day slowly fade out over Stevens Pond, Trevor & I slept with the rain fly off & I woke up occasionally to see clusters of huge stars overhead, & the moon came over the pond incredibly bright; almost hard to sleep by. Woke up at dawn & had coffee & oatmeal to an incredible sunrise mirrored over the pond. Foggy.</p>
                <p>On the trail early & got to Lake Durant Campground quickly, I think we did 3.1 mi in an hour. Some blowdown forcing you off the trail in this section. Ate, got water, & cleaned up in the Lake Durant Campground bathroom, & then through an easy section of trail. Immediately after crossing Rt. 28 the forest changed—shrubby, shorter, broader, buggier. Crossed a cool vlei. Ate on a footbridge at O’Neil Flow, & then rounded Tirrell Pond. I fell into mud up to my knees. There are a few actual sandy beaches here at the campsite & a canoe with a paddle, which Trevor is out on now. Planning on spending the rest of the day swimming & sunning ourselves before our final, hardest section tomorrow.</p>
                <p>[img]</p>
                <p>Just finished with dinner (freeze-dried beef Stroganoff & a whole-wheat pita pocket) & dessert (a Baby Ruth) & hung the bear bag. It’s incredible how much the forest changes—it took us 10 min to find a rock to hang the bear bag, where in other sections we are tripping over them constantly (probably like tomorrow).</p>
                <p>Tirrell Pond was a busy site today as we lounged here—two guys were in the lean-to to start, a couple found us on the sandy beach & camped out there (even though they are not supposed to), & a trip with a 12 yo dog came up on us late in the day. They stopped in the lean-to for a while, but then one of the women came upon Trevor butt naked & sunbathing on a sandbar, & the next thing we knew they were all gone, probably to the next tent site about 2 mi up at Salmon River. Maybe that was their plan all along, or maybe they’re prudes. Trevor & I wanted to reclaim the sandy beach by ‘storming the beaches, hanging dong.’ It was a very nudist day, I rarely wore more than loose shorts, & often not even that. It feels good to be naked in the still, warm water, at eye level with the pond, hearing nothing but your own swimming echoing in the trees, the birds, the crickets, the breeze, & the loons, splashing & calling, just as naked as you are.</p>

                <p>Sitting alone on the beach on an overturned rowboat, watching the steam lift off the pond, waiting for the sun to rise. Waiting? That seems to imply impatience. Watching the sun rise, waiting for this pot of pondwater to boil for coffee.</p>

                <h3>7/29</h3>
                <p>On Larry & Kathy’s back porch with a coffee, with Emilio sleeping in a chair next to me.</p>
                <p>After breakfast yesterday we hiked through from Tirrell Pond out to a logging road, lots of blowdown & treacherous sections here. Walked along the road to a large vehicle bridge over Salmon River & then back up into the woods. Pretty straightforward, moderate incline with a stream below on our left much of the way, perhaps with a dam or large section of boulders, it was hard to tell from the trail.</p>
                <p>(I forgot to mention—in the first section, I was leading, & in addition to eating all the cobwebs across the trail, I saw two grouses [grice?], or at least that’s what I think they were, big fat gray gamebirds which I startled in the brush & which startled me when they took off. Shortly after, screened by some brush, I heard a large land animal take off running away from the trail as we apporached—maybe a deer?)</p>
                <p>At the head of this hill was an incredible broad meadow of grass, shining green & gold, bathed in the sun. we crossed it along a vague footpath of stomped grass, under the view of a nearby ridge & surrounded by conifers. A stream ran through a gulley in the middle of the meadow—the map says there’s a footbridge here, we think, but there was only a treebranch to balance on to cross the stream. But it was little more than a trickle, so this was plenty.</p>
                <p>After the meadow we started climbing in earnest, stopping briefly at a stream crossing to re-up on water. Climbing the ridge was moderately steep until the last 1000 ft or so, which were tough, but never truly vertical. I was having trouble with this section in my post-covid state. But the sharp ascent ended quickly, & although the map shows a scenic viewpoint at the peak of the ridge, we only saw a window where the trees were maybe slightly thinner. The book says you can see through here to Long Lake when there are no leaves, but we had to check the map to confirm we’d passed it. Pretty along the ridge.</p>
                <p>The descent was moderate & not terribly long, punctuated by a footbridge. After this was a long, flat walk through the woods, sometimes intersecting with a yellow-marked cross-country ski trail. After a brief walk on a green road through the forest we completed the hike with a crazy, variety-hour last mile which seemed to pass through every type of forest—flat, hilly, dry, stony, boards, leafy, evergreen, boggy, mossy, boards after boards. Maybe 0.7 mi from the register was the most bizarre sight, a hard, clean break between two totally separate types of forest—from hilly & leafy to a bog of tall conifers—maybe spruces? But the brush, the leaves & the undergrowth ended at a stark border & beyond that only moss, boards, & the dense, sparsely-limbed trees. In this section the forest was perfectly silent.</p>
                <p>We ended on the side of 28N, dumped our packs in the car, & drove over to Long Lake, where we got burgers, fries, & ice cream. I had the best Corona of my life. The the drive back to Wakely Dam, past the cemetery & down the endless gravel road, to lay in the grass one more time by the ranger station before separating our gear into the two cars & splitting up. The sun was still high in the sky.</p>

                <h3>7/24/2025</h3>
                <p>Sitting in an Adirondack chair on the beach at the heel of Long Lake, watching a seaplane taxi under the overpass to my left & then launch behind us into the sky. I can still smell the airplane’s fuel. From here I can see three major prominences jutting out from the forest into the water, all of which we’ll hike past tomorrow. Final leg of the journey. It was hot today as we rode up, surprisingly so, but now in the shade of the trees the sun has already sunk behind the air is perfect, temperate to the point of imperceptibility, gently breezy, calm, perfect is again the word, it’s perfect. The water is calmly rippled & lapping serenely on the beach.</p>
                <p>We’re staying at the Adirondack Hotel, a beautiful inn & tavern founded in the mid-1800s with a bar, restaurant, dining room, parlor with a recently-tuned piano, & tiny rooms with brass beds. Our twin beds face each other & that’s the entire size of the room. It’s run by a family of women, sisters & cousins who inherited the place from their grandmother. I asked which floor was haunted, & she said her grandmother, who only had one leg, shuffled back & forth between ‘uptown’ & ‘downtown’, two different windows on the second floor. But she said that the place was full of love & happy memories, & that the only spirits were served with wine.</p>
                <p>We revisited the end of the trail for the first time since retrieving the car in 2020; I recognized Averyville Road immediately. There was an exhausted group of two guys & a girl airing themselves out at the end of the trail. With any luck, in three days’ time, we’ll be doing the same—the level of fatigue suggested that maybe they had just thru-hiked it, but we’ll see just how taxing this last stretch is. Or they might have been on something.</p>

                <p>Laying next to Trevor in the tent inside Cold Spring #4 after a long, sweaty, arduous day. Something like 13.1 mi, a record high for us on the NPT. Late start, 10am. A woman tried to give us a ride to the trailhead, but we’d just started. Quickly got lost after the campsites at Catlin Bay, where the trail widens & disappears—bushwacked our way along the water before finding the trail at Hidden Cove. Kelly Point was the nicest, a stone bench on the water—long break here. Hidden campsite just after.</p>
                <p>Boggy, wet, unkempt stretch to the Plumley lean-tos—another long break for lunch. Left again at 4:30pm after debating spending the night there. 4 mi eating branches to Shattuck Clearing, which is nothing, & then two suspension bridges over the stunning Cold River to this lean-to, the best of the NPT, for a heavenly swim, washing away the sweat & grime. Probably stars, but too tired. Proud of the day & feeling fantastic. Exhausted.</p>

                <p>In the tent at Duck Hole #1. Jack & Trevor in the tent next to me. Another tiring 11 mi. Spend the morning on the gorgeous & perfect Cold River, having breakfast & coffee by the falls under the suspension bridge, & then hiking several miles along its banks. Wide, deep pools, rushing falls, & rocks everywhere in the sun to lay out & enjoy it.</p>
                <p>After turning away from the river we encountered the Rondeau hermitage, little more now than a rusty collection of buckets & junk, but an interesting reminder & memento of a man who once lived out here, wild. The last?</p>
                <p>Then sweaty & narrow hiking, then broad trails. Mentally very tired at points today.</p>
                <p>Dinner by the water of Duck Hole, threw rocks, watched the clouds turn red & then got in the tent, away from the bugs.</p>

                <h3>7/27</h3>
                <p>Laying on my sleeping pad on the floor of the Pines Inn in Lake Placid. Town is overrun with teenage rugby & lacrosse players, some kind of tournament weekend. Battling(?) with annoying people.</p>
                <p>Woke up at 4am in the Duck Hole lean-to to the sound of crashing rain, sprung outside to make sure my boots weren’t getting drenched. Woke up again at 6, 7, & 8, & each time it was still pouring. Slow start to the day because of it, cozy inside the lean-to & pouring outside. The privy was just a box so got soaked there & was wet the rest of the day.</p>
                <p>Hiking through the rain in the morning was fun, engaging, foliage shining green, felt very determined & focused. Reached Moose Pond & shared the lean-to with an older guy who shares a camp with his wife, & this was the week every year where she invites five lady friends to stay, so he had to disappear into the woods for a week. He was stopping there for the day, wringing out his shirt & socks. His wife was picking him up tomorrow.</p>
                <p>After the lean-to was 1.6 brutal, slippery, muddy, branch-bound miles to the junction with Wanika Falls. There’s a tent site there (no privy) but little else—no great view or good places to sit. A downcast lunch, cut short to get the hell out of there.</p>
                <p>From there we had 6.5 mi to the finish line. This final stretch was long, but finally broad, wide, easy trail—a joy after the difficult & treacherous morning. We only stopped once at a small pond. Towards the end I was thinking about being done, always thinking the trailhead was around the next corner—but then the sky opened up on us one last time & absolutely dumped on us, which helped me refocus & regain my determination. I was like, “give me what you’ve got.” Trevor was running on the trail ahead of me.</p>
                <p>He pointed his fingers in the air & looked back at me, & a few steps later, through the trees, I saw cars in the parking lot of the trailhead. I signed us out & we dropped our packs on Jack’s car. The sun came out & there was smoke coming off the road.</p>
