			<h2>“The Weather in Portland”</h2>
			<p>
				It’s nighttime now, and after looking<br>
				at the stars I’m wondering<br>
				what the sky looks like in Portland<br>
				<br>
				where my dad is now. He’s<br>
				not a stern man,<br>
				but he doesn’t joke either,<br>
				<br>
				he’s always looking for<br>
				a laugh, telling a story.<br>
				I wonder what he’s telling<br>
				<br>
				her right now, as they look<br>
				out on the gray, drizzling<br>
				sky through deep panes<br>
				<br>
				of glass. I wonder how<br>
				the streetlight’s reflecting off<br>
				his glasses and into the room,<br>
				<br>
				in a few different directions,<br>
				glinting and exciting the cat whenever<br>
				a wrinkle of the nose pushes<br>
				<br>
				at the frames. And<br>
				when he gets back sometime<br>
				in the coming weeks, I’ll ask him<br>
				<br>
				about the weather in Portland,<br>
				how long was the flight,<br>
				and I’ll let him tell the rest,<br>
				<br>
				his successes in words,<br>
				failures in the pauses between them.

			<h2>“Binoculars”</h2>
				<p>
					The cup’s sitting on the windowsill to dry,<br>
					all covered in droplets in the sun,<br>
					squeaky clean,<br>
					<br>
					and while that’s true, it’s disingenuous,<br>
					there’s so much more going on that it’s<br>
					<br>
					almost unfair to narrow in like that<br>
					<br>
					because I know somewhere out there you may be<br>
					thinking as I am, looking at the trees<br>
					that won’t be barren for much longer,<br>
					<br>
					seeing their stark branches like bones,<br>
					thousands of skeleton arms reaching wildly to the sky,<br>
					gesticulating, demanding the warmth of the sun<br>
					<br>
					that will bring you and I back together.<br>
					Until then, I sit as you do,<br>
					peering through the leafless world, trying to find you looking back.
				</p>

			<h2>“I Wish I Was an Engineer”</h2>
			<p>
				I wish I was an engineer<br>
				so I could build a bridge<br>
				to a place where<br>
				<br>
				bridges don’t cross the landscape,<br>
				where the shores are forested with<br>
				shade & coolness that only we’ve found,<br>
				<br>
				that we & only we can share,<br>
				like we felt in the breeze<br>
				we tasted as we carved our names in the tree,<br>
				<br>
				or on so many of those warm<br>
				summer nights on the grassy hill,<br>
				watching the waxing moon melt away<br>
				<br>
				into the tiny twinkling lights on the horizon,<br>
				the king & queen of it all.<br>
				But now that air is sticky & hot<br>
				<br>
				& doesn’t blow like it used to,<br>
				so I’m building a bridge in my mind<br>
				to that cool, shady place where<br>
				<br>
				the rain’s already fallen &<br>
				you’re always in my dreams.<br>
			</p>

			<h2>“The Sky”</h2>
			<p>
				The sky is<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;an endless moving<br>
				tapestry<br>
				<br>
				& everything that is<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;holy & sacred lives<br>
				in it, on it, above it,<br>
				<br>
				beneath it, nothing that is<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;is not holy, is<br>
				not made of<br>
				<br>
				everything, same as we are,<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;living in the sky on<br>
				earth,<br>
				<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;yearning to be, to be, to be
			</p>

			<h2>“Fixing a Hole”</h2>
			<p>
				It looks like rain today,<br>
				tomorrow & forever those brooding<br>
				clouds press down like endless<br>
				indecisions, haunting & spewing<br>
				what they hold dear, arresting us<br>
				in their vagrant uniformity;<br>
				each drop no better or worse than the last,<br>
				just an endless synchronization, a choreographed<br>
				dance of leaves paddled gently by<br>
				the falling rain & blowing<br>
				wind coming through my open window<br>
				to remind me of something I forgot<br>
				long ago, something I maybe didn’t<br>
				want to remember but couldn’t<br>
				afford to forget, for my own sake, &<br>
				maybe someday I’ll thank that heavy,<br>
				turgid breeze for reminding me, for keeping<br>
				me who I am, as I am now, forever—
				<br><br>
