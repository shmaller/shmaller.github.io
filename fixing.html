				“The Weather in Portland”
			</div>

			<div class='poetry'>
It’s nighttime now, and after looking
at the stars I’m wondering
what the sky looks like in Portland

where my dad is now. He’s
not a stern man,
but he doesn’t joke either,

he’s always looking for
a laugh, telling a story.
I wonder what he’s telling

her right now, as they look
out on the gray, drizzling
sky through deep panes

of glass. I wonder how
the streetlight’s reflecting off
his glasses and into the room,

in a few different directions,
glinting and exciting the cat whenever
a wrinkle of the nose pushes

at the frames. And
when he gets back sometime
in the coming weeks, I’ll ask him

about the weather in Portland,
how long was the flight,
and I’ll let him tell the rest,

his successes in words,
failures in the pauses between them.

				“Binoculars”
			</div>

			<div class='poetry'>
The cup’s sitting on the windowsill to dry,
all covered in droplets in the sun,
squeaky clean,

and while that’s true, it’s disingenuous,
there’s so much more going on that it’s

almost unfair to narrow in like that

because I know somewhere out there you may be
thinking as I am, looking at the trees
that won’t be barren for much longer,

seeing their stark branches like bones,
thousands of skeleton arms reaching wildly to the sky,
gesticulating, demanding the warmth of the sun

that will bring you and I back together.
Until then, I sit as you do,
peering through the leafless world, trying to find you looking back.

				“I Wish I Was an Engineer”
			</div>

			<div class='poetry'>
I wish I was an engineer
so I could build a bridge
to a place where

bridges don’t cross the landscape,
where the shores are forested with
shade & coolness that only we’ve found,

that we & only we can share,
like we felt in the breeze
we tasted as we carved our names in the tree,

or on so many of those warm
summer nights on the grassy hill,
watching the waxing moon melt away

into the tiny twinkling lights on the horizon,
the king & queen of it all.
But now that air is sticky & hot

& doesn’t blow like it used to,
so I’m building a bridge in my mind
to that cool, shady place where

the rain’s already fallen &
you’re always in my dreams.

				“The Sky”
			</div>

			<div class='poetry'>
The sky is
&emsp;&emsp;an endless moving
tapestry

& everything that is
&emsp;&emsp;holy & sacred lives
in it, on it, above it,

beneath it, nothing that is
&emsp;&emsp;is not holy, is
not made of

everything, same as we are,
&emsp;&emsp;living in the sky on
earth,

&emsp;&emsp;yearning to be, to be, to be
			</div>

				“Fixing a Hole”
			</div>

			<div class='poetry'>
It looks like rain today,
tomorrow & forever those brooding
clouds press down like endless
indecisions, haunting & spewing
what they hold dear, arresting us
in their vagrant uniformity;
each drop no better or worse than the last,
just an endless synchronization, a choreographed
dance of leaves paddled gently by
the falling rain & blowing
wind coming through my open window
to remind me of something I forgot
long ago, something I maybe didn’t
want to remember but couldn’t
afford to forget, for my own sake, &
maybe someday I’ll thank that heavy,
turgid breeze for reminding me, for keeping
me who I am, as I am now, forever—
